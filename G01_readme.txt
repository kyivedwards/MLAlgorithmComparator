README for G01
--------------

Our project relies mainly on sklearn, pandas and PyTorch.
To visualize the PyTorch models, you need to install torchsummary with the following command in the anaconda console:

pip install torchsummary


Our code submission contains the following files:

The project is divided into four different sections. 
Each section has its own folder with the corresponding notebook and data. Two options to view:
 - Open the pre-run jupyter notebook (.ipynb file)
 - Run the .py file in the relevant folder
